                        , AKA the framework don, to save you from another year of broken New Years Resolutions.

                    <p>
                        I think resolutions suck, <strong>80% of people give up on them by January 19th ("Quitters Day")</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        â€‹So I went looking for a better alternative.

                        The method I'm about to show you I stole from a couple of guys who teach one of the most
                        popular classes at Stanford - the 
                        <a href='https://lifedesignlab.stanford.edu/' target='_blank' className='text-blue-600 hover:underline'> Life Design Lab</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The professors turned the class into a <a href='https://designingyour.life/' target='_blank' className='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>book</a>. And I turned their insights into a framework that I've used for the past 3 years for my new years resolutions.
